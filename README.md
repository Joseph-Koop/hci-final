### Problem Statement
Construction companies need a digital dashboard to track all projects, employees, and equipment in one place because current systems lack real-time visibility and lead to inefficiencies. Our solution is to create a live map that links to projects and shows exactly which employees, equipment, and materials are needed at each location.

### Key features:
- Dashboard to view projects and assign resources
- Map to view project locations
- Project, Equipment, Employee, and Material pages

### To run a local version:
1. Have NodeJS installed.
1. Clone this repository in VS Code or another IDE.
2. Run the command npm run dev in the terminal.

```
npm run dev
```

### Note:
This project is built from a design perspective. Information is not saved to a database - create, update, and delete operations are only temporary.

### Coming soon:
- Backend functionality
- in Software Engineering, 2025-2

Built with React + Vite
